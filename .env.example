# LOCAL ONLY: Environment variables for API keys
# This file is only needed if you are running this jupyter notebook locally and not using Google Colab.
# If you are running this jupyter notebook locally, you need to set your OpenAI API key in an environment variable.
# This file is a template to help you set that up.

# DO NOT USE WITH GOOGLE COLAB
# If you are using Google Colab, you do not need this file.
# Instead, follow the instructions in the `getting-started.ipynb` notebook to set your API key securely.

# Follow the instructions below to set up your OpenAI API key.
# 1. Rename this file to `.env` and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
# 2. Make sure to keep this file secure and do not share it publicly.
# 3. This file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.
# 4. Restart your Jupyter notebook kernel after making changes to this file to ensure the environment variable is loaded.

# 5. This OpenAI API key is accessed in the notebook using the `os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")` function.
# If this file is not set up correctly, the notebook will ask for you to enter your API key manually using getpass each 
# time you run it.


# The following is an example key. You must replace it with your own key from OpenAI.
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Our custom base URL for Harvard's limited access to OpenAI models, this is not the standard OpenAI URL.
# A wrong API key error will be returned if you use a standard OpenAI base url with your Harvard API key.
