# Generative AI API Starter Notebooks

This repository is a beginner-friendly collection of notebooks designed to help you access powerful AI models through their APIs. You can create, analyze, and experiment with these models—your way.

You don't need to be an expert to use these notebooks. Just follow the steps below, and you'll be running your first AI model in minutes.

Best of all, no coding experience is required!

Let's begin.

### 🚀 Step 1: Get Started

Choose the best option for you to begin working with the notebooks.

**Option 1: Open and Run in Colab (Recommended)**

This is the fastest and easiest way to start. Just click the button below, and the notebook will open directly in your browser. You don't need to install anything!

**Option 2: Run Locally**

If you prefer to run the notebook on your own computer, you can download the repository from GitHub. See the [Local Setup](#️-local-setup) section below.

### 🔒 Secure Your API Key

For security, **never share your API key or save it directly in your notebook**. Instead, use a secure method like an environment variable locally, or secrets on Colab. The `getting-started.ipynb` notebook will show you how to do this for your very first run.
