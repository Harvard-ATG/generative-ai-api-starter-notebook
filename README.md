# Generative AI API Starter Notebook

This repository contains a beginner-friendly notebook created for members of those Harvard community who have received an OpenAI API Key from the HUIT Academic Technology Team. Learn more on that process to receive an OpenAI API Key from Academic Technology, here. If you already have your HUIT Academic Technology OpenAI Key, let's dive in!

So, what's an API? An API, or Application Programming Interface, is simply a method to interact with software, like AI models, using code. This notebook will guide you step-by-step and make getting started *easy*!

Using the OpenAI API in this notebook, you will learn how use an API to unlock power model features and gain the skills to create, analyze, and experiment with these models—your way.

You don't need to be an expert to use these notebooks. Just follow the steps below, and you'll be running your first AI model in minutes.

Best of all, no coding experience is required!

Let's begin.

### ⚙️ Local Setup

This section is for users who chose to run the notebooks locally.

* **Clone the Repository:**
    `git clone https://github.com/Harvard-ATG/generative-ai-api-starter-notebook.git`
* **Navigate into the Project Folder:**
    `cd generative-ai-api-starter-notebook`
* **Begin with the Getting Started notebook:**
    `getting_started.ipynb`

### 🔒 Secure Your API Key

For security, **never share your API key or save it directly in your notebook**. Instead, use a secure method like an environment variable locally, or secrets on Colab. The [`getting-started.ipynb`](./getting_started/getting_started.ipynb) notebook will show you how to do this for your very first run.
