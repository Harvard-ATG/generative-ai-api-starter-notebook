## Security

- **Never** post/share your API key publicly (Slack, GitHub, email, etc.)
- Your API Key should be treated like a sensitive password. Follow [Harvard's Information Security and Data Privacy - Protect Identity: Best Practices](https://privsec.harvard.edu/protect-identity) (including the use of Password Managers) to keep your API Key secure.
- If distributing keys for others, do so securely by following Harvard [secure email](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=cea973b3dbf8e0d0441560fdd39619d8) or [secure file transfer](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=3c725c7d47016950566cf147536d43ff) policies. Only share **one API key per user**—instruct recipients about key security
- The Starter Notebook provides secure setup guidance
