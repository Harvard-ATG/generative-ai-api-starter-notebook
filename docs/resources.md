## Getting Started with Your Access

**Once you receive your key:**

* **API Access:** Enables use of the OpenAI Direct API for integration in research/code/projects.
    * API keys should be treated like passwords. Please follow [Harvard's Privacy and Security Policies](https://privsec.harvard.edu/protect-identity) for securing passwords, including use of password managers (i.e. 1Password).
    * *Note: This is NOT the public ChatGPT website.*
* **Starter Notebook:** [Use the Generative AI API Starter Notebook](https://github.com/Harvard-ATG/generative-ai-api-starter-notebook/blob/main/README.md) – beginner-friendly, no programming required.
    * *Recommended:* Launch directly in your browser with Google Colab.
